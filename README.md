# Fragrance Bot

### Description
This is the final project on the Project Management course that I did with my team (three members). The project is about building a Chatbot that using Microsoft Bot Framework integrates with LUIS service and Azure Search Service, this bot can detect user intents and help them search for fragrance products and suggest fragrances depend on information from the user.
